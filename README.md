# UltimateTicTacToe
It's like normal tic tac toe game but in every "square" you play tic tac toe again C:
Rules might be confusing at first but that why i made this and "red square" shows you where you can make your move.
Basically player's previous move tells you where you can go. For example player one choose top right "BIG" square and  top left "SMALL" square. Because player one choose top right small square you have to move to top left BIG square and so on. When small square is already "finished" (that means someone won in small square) player can go wherever he wants (in red squares).
